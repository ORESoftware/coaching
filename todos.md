we could use the issues page, but for now:

1. improve css etc using vanillajs or similar
2. improve coach search
3. improve dnd and design for coach matching
4. move images to cdn
5. move host to something better than gh-pages
6. point dancingdragons.cc to our host using gsuite and squarespace
7. move to nextjs
8. the intake page will be like dancingdragons.cc/intake
